"A brief history of Hunt the Wumpus

Hunt the Wupus was a popular early oc mputer game written by Gregory Yob in 1976.  It puts you in the shoes of an intrepid
explorer, delving into a network of caves in search of the hairy, smelly, mysterius beast known only as the wumpus.  Many
hazards faced the player, including bats, bottomless pits, and, of course, the wumpus.  Because the original game was 
released with source code, it allowed users to create their own versions of Hunt the Wumpus with different cave hazards.
Ultimately, reinterpretations of Wumpus led to the development of an entire genre of first-person adventure games, such as
Adventure and Zork.
